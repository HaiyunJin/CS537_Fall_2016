<h1>Project 2b: xv6 Scheduler</h1> 
</font> 
</center> 

<b>You may work with a project partner from your discussion section for the Scheduler portion of this project.</b>

<h2>Objectives</h2> 

<p>There are three objectives to this assignment:</p> 

<ul>

<li>To understand code for performing context-switches in the xv6 kernel.

<li>To implement a basic MLFQ scheduler.</li> 

<li>To show how process behavior (i.e., how long a
  process uses the CPU before performing I/O or sleeping) interacts
  with the scheduler by creating an interesting timeline graph. </li>

</ul> 

<h2>Overview</h2> 

<p>In this project, you'll be implementing a simplified <b>multi-level
feedback queue (MLFQ)</b> scheduler in xv6.

<p>The basic idea is simple.  Build an MLFQ scheduler with four
  priority queues; the top queue (numbered 0) has the highest priority
  and the bottom queue (numbered 3) has the lowest priority.  When a
  process uses up its time-slice (counted as a number of ticks), it
  should be downgraded to the next (lower) priority level.  The
  time-slices for higher priorities will be shorter than lower
  priorities.

<h2>Details</h2> 

<p> You have three specific tasks for this part of the project.

<h3> Implement MLFQ</h3>
 Your MLFQ scheduler must follow these very
  precise rules:

<ol>
<li> At any given point in time, the highest-priority ready process should
  be run.  
<p>
<li> The time-slice for priority 0 should be 2 timer ticks.  The
  times-slice for priority 1 is 5 timer ticks; for priority 2, it is 10 timer
  ticks; for priority 3, it is 20 timer ticks.    If no higher priority job arrives and the running process does
  not relinquish the CPU, then that process will scheduled for an
  entire time-slice before the scheduler switches to another process.
<p>
<li> When a process is first created, it is be placed at the
  highest priority.  Place this process at the end of the high
  priority queue.
<p>
<li> When a timer tick occurs, whichever process was currently using
  the CPU should be considered to have used up an entire timer tick's
  worth of CPU.  (Note that a timer tick is different than the
  time-slice.)
<p>
<li> If a process wakes up after voluntarily relinquishing the CPU (by
  performing I/O or sleeping), it should be placed at the back of its
  queue.  It should not preempt a process at the same priority but is
  should immediately preempt processes at lower priorities.
<p>
<li> Whenever a process uses up its time-slice at a given priority
  level, it is moved to the next lower priority.  When a proces is
  moved to a lower priority level, it should be placed at the end
  of the corresponding queue.
<p>
<li> A round-robin scheduler should be used for processes at the
  lowest priority.
<p>
<li> After each 1 second interval, if a runnable process has not been
scheduled at all in that interval, its priority should be bumped up by
one level (placed at the front of the corresponding queue) and given a
new time-slice.  Details: The scheduler should have a global 1 second interval in which
every runnable process is evaluated for starvation; a process should
not be evaluated for starvation in its first 1 second interval.
<p>
</ol>

<h3>Create getpinfo()</h3> 

You'll need to create one new system call for this project: <b>int
getpinfo(struct pstat *)</b> .

<p>
This routine
returns some basic information about each process: its process ID, how
many timer ticks it has acquired, which queue it is currently placed on (0,
1, 2, or 3), and its current <tt>procstate</tt> (e.g., SLEEPING,
RUNNABLE, or RUNNING).  
<p>
To do this, you will need to fill in
the <b>pstat</b> structure as defined here: <a href=pstat.h>here.</a>
Do not change the names of the fields in pstat.h</p>

<h3> Make a graph</h3> 

You should make a graph (or set of graphs)
that show some timelines of processes running with your scheduler,
including which queue each process is on, and how much CPU they
received.  
<p> For this graph, you should run xv6 on only a single CPU (the
default is two).  To do this, use:
<pre>
make qemu CPUS=1
</pre>

(Hint: When debugging you may find it useful to run on a single CPU.
However, your final scheduler should work on any number of CPUs).

<p>
To obtain the info for your graph, you should use the
<tt>getpinfo()</tt> system call.  Make up a workload (or set of workloads) that
vary how long each process uses the CPU before voluntarily
relinquishing the CPU (e.g., by calling sleep()).  Think about what
types of workloads will show interesting and useful results.  Use the
graphs to prove to us that your scheduler is working as desired.</p>


<h2>Tips</h2> 

<p>Most of the code for the scheduler is quite localized and can be found in
<b>proc.c</b> ; the associated header file, <b>proc.h</b> is also quite useful to
examine. To change the scheduler, not much needs to be done; study its control
flow and then try some small changes.</p> 

<p> As part of the information that you track for each process, you
  will probably want to know its current priority level and the number
  of timer ticks it has left (before it will be demoted to the next
  lower priority or, if it is already at the lowest priority, moved to
  the end of the round-robin queue).  

<p>You'll need to understand how to fill in the structure <b>pstat</b> in the
kernel and pass the results to user space. The structure looks like what you
see in <a href=pstat.h>here.</a> </p> 

<h2>The Code</h2> 

<p>The source code for xv6 (and associated README) can be found in <b>
~cs537-1/ta/xv6/</b> . Everything you need to build and run and even
debug the kernel is in there.</p>

<p>You may also find the following readings about xv6 useful, written by the
same team that ported xv6 to x86:
<a href=http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2011/xv6/book-rev6.pdf>xv6 book.</a> </p> 

<h2>What To Turn In</h2> 

<p>Beyond the usual code, you'll have to <b>make a graph</b> for this
assignment.   You can use whatever graphing tool you would like
  ("gnuplot" is a fine, basic choice).  When
  you have your graph, please create a .pdf version of it and place it
  in a file named <b>graph.pdf</b>.  If you have multiple
  graphs, name them <b>graph1.pdf</b>, <b>graph2.pdf</b> and so one.
<p> Please describe the workload that you ran to create your graph and
  explain why your graph shows the results that it does.  You can
  either put this explanatory text directly in <b>graph.pdf</b> or in
  a separate file <b>workload.pdf</b> or <b>workload.txt</b> (if you
  use plain text).    These are the only formats and filenames you
  should use.
