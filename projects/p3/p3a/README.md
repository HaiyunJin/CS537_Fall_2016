Existing bug:

Currently, the NUMBER_OF_BUFFERS are set to 4,
When a 5th client wants to join, the pid of the 4th proc being printed 
magically changed to 1.


Almost finished except stats_init() and stats_unlink() functions.
It is kind of hard to determine the calling process by the key argument
only. We need to talk.
